# PyBer_Analysis
- Created overall snapshot of ride-sharing data.
- Added visualizations such as scatter and pie charts to easily view data
- Generated summary table of key metrics of ride-sharing data by city type
-Generated milti-line graph that shows average fare for each week by each city type

## Summary DataFrame Analysis
- This summary chart depicts the total rides, drivers, fares, average fare/ride and average fare/driver in the 3 different areas, Rural, Suburban, and Urban
- The total number of rides in Rural cities are 5 to 12 times less than that of Suburban and Urban cities respectively
- There seems to be a correlation in total rides and average fare per ride in which it is more expensive in rural areas, costing an average of $34.62/ride, than in suburban or even urban areas costing an average of $30.97/ride and $24.53/ride respectively.
- Looking at the total number of drivers within a given area and the average fare per driver, we see that since there aren't as many drivers in Rural areas than urban areas, we see the average fare per driver be high at $55.49 with 78 total drivers, as apposed to Urban areas Average fare per driver being $16.57 with 2,405 total drivers.

- We can see that the total fares in Rural areas are consistantly the lowest compared to suburban and rural areas with rural areas being the highest throughout the beginning of January 2019 to the end of April 2019
